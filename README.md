## Getting Started

Base commands for develop, test and build.

**Requirements**

- Node.js Toolchain Manager: [Volta](https://volta.sh)
- Package Manager: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

**Prepare Development**

A **Makefile** is used to orchestrate the installation of required tooling and dependencies. Open your Terminal app and run the command bellow, then you are able to get started.

```sh
make
```

> **Note**
>
> In case of failure, head to the [**Troubleshooting**](/#troubleshooting) section below for alternatives.

**Development Server**

The next command will spawn the Dev Server and load the Env Vars from `.env`, `.env.development` and `.env.local`.

```sh
# spawns the Dev Server at http://localhost:3000
pnpm dev
```

**Testing**

There are **Integration**, **Unit** and **E2E** tests available and the matching test environment variables (`.env.test`) are automatically loaded. With the exception of E2E tests, these commands are also used for CI environments.

```sh
# Unit & Integration Tests
pnpm test     # run tests without watch
pnpm test:w   # run tests with watch
pnpm test:c   # run tests with coverage
pnpm t        # alias for `pnpm test`
```

```sh
# E2E Tests
pnpm test:e2e # runs with **dev server** as Base URL
```

**Linting & Code Formatting**

We split the process into Check and Fix commands.

```sh
# Linting
pnpm lint:check # checks linting without fixing (useful for CI)
pnpm lint       # checks linting and fixes issues
```

```sh
# Code Formatting
pnpm fmt:check # checks formatting without fixing (useful for CI)
pnpm fmt       # checks formatting and fixes issues
```

## Building

Builds are separated by environments: Production and Staging. For both environments the `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`.

**Production**

Refer to `./config/envs/.env.production` for the environment variables.

```sh
pnpm build:prod # builds with production bindings
pnpm start:prod # starts the built app with production bindings
```

**Staging**

Refer to `./config/envs/.env.staging` for the environment variables.

```sh
pnpm build:stag # builds with staging bindings
pnpm start:stag # starts the built app with staging bindings
```

## Cleanup

Whenever you need a fresh start in case something is going wrong, you can leverage handy cleanup commands.

```sh
pnpm cleanup # remove caches and temp files
pnpm cleanup:hard # same as above but also remove `node_modules`
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Fail while using the `make` command:** Behind the scenes this command depends on `cURL` for downloading Volta and pnpm binaries. Try installing cURL then run the command again. Also, the commands from Makefile are **not supported on Windows** machines so the alternative is manually installing the required dependencies.

Altough this **template** itself is MIT licensed, if needed, you must change the license after creating your project.
