## Getting Started

Base commands for develop, test and build.

**Requirements**

- <img width="16" height="16" src="https://nodejs.org/static/images/favicons/favicon.png" /> Node.js Toolchain Manager: [Volta](https://volta.sh)
- <img width="16" height="16" src="https://docs.npmjs.com/favicon-32x32.png?v=c2963dcad859b2b320d26051c38197fe" alt="npm logo" /> Package Manager: [npm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- <img width="16" height="16" src="https://caddyserver.com/resources/images/favicon.png?v=5a994ae" /> HTTP(S) Web Server: [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) _optional_

**Prepare Development**

A **Makefile** is used to orchestrate the installation of required tooling and dependencies. To get started, open a Terminal session and run the command bellow. **Make sure to install Caddy manually to enable HTTPS on Dev.**

```sh
make
```

> **Note**
>
> In case of failure, head to the [**Troubleshooting**](#troubleshooting) section below for alternatives.

**Development Server**

The next command will spawn the Dev Server and load the environment variables from `.env`.

```sh
pnpm dev        # spawns the Dev Server at http://localhost:3000
pnpm dev:secure # spawns Caddy and the Dev Server at https://localhost:3000
```

**Testing**

There are **Integration**, **Unit** and **E2E** tests available and the matching test environment variables (`.env.test`) are automatically loaded. With the exception of E2E tests, these commands are also used for CI environments.

```sh
# Unit & Integration Tests
pnpm test     # run tests without watch
pnpm test:w   # run tests with watch
pnpm test:c   # run tests with coverage
pnpm t        # alias for `pnpm test`
```

```sh
# E2E Tests
pnpm test:e2e # runs with **dev server** as Base URL
```

**Linting & Code Formatting**

We split the process into Check and Fix commands.

```sh
# Linting
pnpm lint:check # checks linting without fixing (useful for CI)
pnpm lint       # checks linting and fixes issues
```

```sh
# Code Formatting
pnpm fmt:check # checks formatting without fixing (useful for CI)
pnpm fmt       # checks formatting and fixes issues
```

## Environment Variables

Sensitive and secret data can be defined using Environment Variables. An `.env` file at the root directory can be used for storing these data. As per security `.env` files cannot be tracked through version control systems.

## Application Properties

Application properties define environment-specific, static configuration for the app. Unlike Environment Variables, Properties cannot include sensitive values.

There are the `base`, `dev`, `production` and `staging` properties but it's possible to add many others, as they are named based on the value of `APP_ENV` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` environment variable. Also they are separated by `client` and `server`.

The properties from `base` holds all the default configuration that applies for all environments. Overriding these values is made possible by using the environment specific property file, like `dev`.

In short, when `APP_ENV` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` is set to `production`, `base` and `production` property files will be loaded and merged. Then they can be accessed through the application as bellow:

```ts
import { serverProperties } from "@/config/properties/server";
import { clientProperties } from "@/config/properties/client";
```

---

## Building

Builds are separated by environments: Production and Staging. For both environments the `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`.

**Production**

```sh
pnpm build:prod # build with production bindings
pnpm start:prod # start the built app with production bindings
```

**Staging**

```sh
pnpm build:stag # build with staging bindings
pnpm start:stag # start the built app with staging bindings
```

## Cleanup

When a fresh start is needed in case something is going wrong, use the available cleanup commands.

```sh
pnpm cleanup      # remove caches and temp files
pnpm cleanup:hard # same as above but also remove `node_modules`
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Fail while using the `make` command:** Behind the scenes this command depends on `cURL` for downloading Volta and pnpm binaries. Try installing cURL then run the command again. Also, the commands from Makefile are **not supported on Windows** machines so the alternative is to manually installing the required dependencies.
